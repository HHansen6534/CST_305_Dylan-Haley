1. Install PyCharm and its associated python edition.
   - go to the link https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
   - select community edition and continue with the installation steps
   - ensure that once downloaded, the program is able to start
2. For the python editions, utilize versions 2 & 3
   - use the link https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - scroll through the different versions, I used python version 3.10 (64 bit) 
   - follow the installation steps and ensure that the program can open
3. Open Pycharm and locate your python file (extension for pycharm files end in .py)
   - In this case, it is our Project 6.py and Project6Part3.py located in this repository
4. If a file is not already downloaded
   - navigate to file > create a new file > name the file <filename>.py
5. Once the file is loaded, make sure to install all necessary packages.
   - install packages > <package name> > install
   - The packages we use for this project include matplotlib, time, and numpy
6. Run the python file!
   - run > run 'filename.py'
